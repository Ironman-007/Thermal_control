# Thermal_control

Due to my research, I always need to measure, log, and control the temperature of the environment during some experiment, such as TVAC test, etc. So I think it would be great to have a standard Kit to do this.
I made this for my personal usage, with 4 channels of RTD to measure temeprature and 4 channels of heater control.
